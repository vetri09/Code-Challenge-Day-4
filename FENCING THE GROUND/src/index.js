//The college ground is rectangular in shape. The Management decides to build a fence around the ground. 
// In order to help the construction workers to build a straight fence, they planned to place a thick rope around the ground. 
// They wanted to buy only the exact length of the rope that is needed. 
// They also wanted to cover the entire ground with a thick carpet during rainy season. 
// They wanted to buy only the exact quantity of carpet that is needed. They requested your help.

// Can you please help them by writing a function to find the exact length of the rope and the exact quantity of carper that is required?


// Write the function to retrun the exact length of the rope.
function find_length(Length,Width){
    return (Length*2)+(Width*2);
}

// Write the function to retrun the exact quantity of carper that is required.
function find_carper(Length,Width){
    return Length*Width;
}

//Use SpecRunner to check the Test Cases.
